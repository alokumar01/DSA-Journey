⚔️ BINARY TREE MASTER WEAPON — THE COMPLETE PATTERN ROADMAP

Use this list for lifetime.

⭐ STEP 1 — LEARN PATTERNS IN THIS ORDER

This order builds your brain step-by-step:

1️⃣ Height / Depth Pattern
2️⃣ DFS Traversals
3️⃣ BFS / Level Order
4️⃣ Diameter Pattern
5️⃣ Balanced Tree Pattern
6️⃣ Path Sum Pattern
7️⃣ LCA Pattern
8️⃣ BST Patterns
⭐ STEP 2 — HOW TO PRACTICE EACH PATTERN

For each pattern you will do EXACTLY this:

✔ Step A: Watch 1 short explanation video (5–10 mins max)

(just the idea)

✔ Step B: Solve 3 main questions from the pattern

(not more)

✔ Step C: After solving, write 2–3 lines in notes:

recursion returns what?

combine how?

base case?

✔ Step D: MOVE TO NEXT PATTERN

DO NOT over-solve.
DSA skill comes from variety, not repetition.

⭐ STEP 3 — EXACT LEETCODE QUESTIONS FOR EACH PATTERN

(Your weapon list — save it)

🔵 PATTERN 1 — HEIGHT / DEPTH (start here)

Core idea: return height from children.

Solve these (IN ORDER):

104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

543. Diameter of Binary Tree (uses height; do here OR in pattern 4)

Solve ONLY 3.

🟢 PATTERN 2 — DFS Traversals

(very easy)

144. Preorder Traversal

94. Inorder Traversal

145. Postorder Traversal

🟡 PATTERN 3 — BFS / LEVEL ORDER

102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

107. Level Order (Bottom-Up)

199. Binary Tree Right Side View

🔴 PATTERN 4 — DIAMETER

If not done earlier.

543. Diameter of Binary Tree (REPEAT for mastery)

124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum (hard but important)

🟣 PATTERN 5 — BALANCED TREE

110. Balanced Binary Tree

257. Binary Tree Paths (helps recursion thinking)

606. Construct String from Binary Tree (optional)

🟠 PATTERN 6 — PATH SUM FAMILY

112. Path Sum

113. Path Sum II

437. Path Sum III (important)

🟤 PATTERN 7 — LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)

236. LCA of Binary Tree

1644. LCA II (optional)

235. LCA of BST (easy)

🟩 PATTERN 8 — BST Patterns

700. Search in BST

701. Insert into BST

98. Validate BST (important)

⭐ STEP 4 — TOTAL NUMBER OF PROBLEMS

Only 3 from each pattern
Total = 8 patterns × 3 = 24 problems

24 problems →
Binary Trees fully mastered.

That’s ALL.
Not 100 questions. Not grind.

⭐ STEP 5 — HOW TO SOLVE (PROCESS)

When you open a LeetCode question:

1. Identify Pattern

Ask:

“Which pattern does this belong to?”
(height? BFS? LCA?)

2. Write these 3 lines BEFORE coding:

“My recursion returns: ____”

“Left + Right gives me: ____”

“I combine them by: ____”

3. Write basic recursion skeleton
function dfs(node) {
    if (!node) return ...;

    let left = dfs(node.left);
    let right = dfs(node.right);

    // combine logic

    return ...;
}

4. Fill logic

Your brain now does the real problem.

⭐ STEP 6 — WHEN TO MOVE TO NEXT PATTERN

If:

✔ You solved 3 problems
✔ You understood the structure
✔ You wrote 2–3 line notes

MOVE ON.
Do NOT overstay.

Tree mastery = quick pattern rotation, NOT repetition.

⭐ FINAL CONCISE SUMMARY (Save this)

Total Patterns: 8
Total Problems: 24
Order: Height → DFS → BFS → Diameter → Balanced → Path Sum → LCA → BST
Learn: 3 problems per pattern
Method: identify pattern → 3 notes → skeleton → logic
